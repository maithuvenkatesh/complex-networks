# Complex Networks
A workshop to introduce attendees to Complex Network theory and its applications.

# Theory

## Network
A network is a collection of objects where pairs of objects are connected together by links. A network can be mathematically represented as a graph. 

## Types of Networks


## Properties of a Network

Given a graph G with N nodes and E edges, let's define the properties of a network.

### Node Degree
The degree of a node is the number edges or links that it shares with another node in the graph.

### Average Node Degree
The average node degree is the average number of connections per node in the graph. This only takes into account the existence of a connection between nodes, not the weight of the connection (if one exists).

### Modularity
The modularity is a measure of strength of division of the network into communities or clusters.
